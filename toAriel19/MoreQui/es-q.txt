%%% Exercise on generators

Sets can be seen as lists without repetitions. Validate the set
version of the ordered/insert property, namely

"if ss is an ordered set then inserting x in ss is still ordered"

You need to define a generator such that it only emits ordered lists
w/o repetitions. Then quantify over such list.

Hint: use mapFilter with the remove function as seen before

(Again: use lists, not Sets)

Finally, redefine you generator so that lists are not only ordered and
w/o repetitions, but  also have length between 3 and 7.
